Magisk Module fixing Mifare functional on some Xiaomi devices

I discovered that on some Xiaomi devices the functionality for working with Mifare Classic cards is broken, which is why some applications for reading ID cards and travel tickets do not work. With this module, this functionality is restored.

This module tested on Xiaomi Mi Note 10 lite. Testing still in progress. If you have problems with it, just deactivate or remove this module then reboot.

Pre-release updated.
